# TwitterSentimentProject
Final Project for Applied Data Science

This is my final project for the course Applied Data Science at Simmons University. This was an open-ended project that allowed us to choose any data we wanted and create a data analysis project wrapped up in an R package. For my project, I chose to retreive data from Twitter about the use of "Black lives matter" in tweets and compare the sentiment of these tweets to the sentiment of tweets containing "All lives matter" and see if there were any major sentiment differences around the United States. 

For the data collection process, I had to apply for a Twitter Developer account to be able to pull tweets into a dataframe. To ensure that the data I was generating was representative, and not only the capitals of each state, I generated a random city or town from each state, got its latitude and longitude, and then collected tweets from a radius within that geocode. 

Becuase the process of the project involved using my unique developer keys to collect tweets, and the fact that I had to go through an appication process, I will not be sharing the full R package here. The uploaded html is the visualization and explanation of my findings.
